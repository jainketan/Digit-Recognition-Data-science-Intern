Dataset: MNIST dataset of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
Model: Implemented using a range of models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Implements models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and CNN.
Achieves high accuracy (~99%) on test data with CNN.
Includes training visualization (accuracy/loss curves) and confusion matrix for evaluation



Libraries Used:
TensorFlow / Keras for deep learning
Scikit-learn for traditional machine learning models
Matplotlib for visualization
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Training & Evaluation: The model is trained on 60,000 images and tested on 10,000 images.
Accuracy: The CNN model achieves a high level of accuracy (~99%) on test data.
Visualization: Plots of accuracy and loss during training, and confusion matrix to show performance.
